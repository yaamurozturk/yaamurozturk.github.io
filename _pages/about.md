Glad to see you here! 

I am a PhD candidate in computer science working on open science, scholarly publishing, and research integrity within the European Research Council (ERC) Synergy project [*Nanobubbles*](https://nanobubbles.hypotheses.org/). This project focuses on "*How, when and why science fails to correct itself?*", and so do I. Here is a picture of my team! <br/><img src='/images/nanobubbles.jpg'>

Throughout my PhD, I worked on developing methods and tools to support post-publication peer review and to better understand the propagation of unreliable research in the scientific literature, particularly regarding citations to retracted publications (aka the concept of [Feet of Clay](https://www.irit.fr/~Guillaume.Cabanac/problematic-paper-screener/feet-of-clay/)). You can check out my [publications](https://yaamurozturk.github.io/publications/) and [talks](https://yaamurozturk.github.io/talks/) to learn more about my research. 

Alongside my academic work, I am actively involved in science communication, including co-maintaining open-access resources such as the [Collection of Open Science Integrity Guides (COSIG)](https://cosig.net/) , managing project outreach channels, and co-organizing international scientific events. As a bonus, I also very much enjoy designing booklets and mascots for such events (check out my [portfolio](https://yaamurozturk.github.io/portfolio/)) and selected [communication materials](https://yaamurozturk.github.io/year-archive/)! 

Currently based in Grenoble, France. <br/><img src='/images/grenoble.jpeg'>
