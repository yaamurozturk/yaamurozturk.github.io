With Bart Penders, Willem Halffman, Serge Horbach and Yj Erden, we are organizing a track for the STS NL conference in Twente. Details about the track is [here](https://www.utwente.nl/en/bms/sts-nl2026/call-for-abstracts-for-presentations-and-posters/track-topic-abstracts/7-making-science-better/). 


Calls to “make science better” are increasingly prominent across academic and public discourse, in campaigns for research integrity, open science, assessment reform, improved replicability or methodological rigour. Yet such calls raise fundamental questions: What does “better” mean? What constitutes “high-quality” research, and who decides? How can research quality be recognised, maintained, and fostered across diverse scientific contexts? 
This track invites contributions that critically examine the concept of research quality as a normative construct in current reform efforts. Discussions of quality are never neutral—they are shaped by values, interests, and power relations, interfering with related concepts of research integrity and ethics, as well as traditional discussions of boundary work: what should even be considered as matters of science?
Concerns about the alleged corruption of scientific literature, through paper mills and predatory journals meet concerns about the alleged institutional corruption of science through powerful economic or industrial interests. Together they highlight the vulnerability of scientific systems to manipulation. In parallel, (geo)political tensions and rapid technological developments, especially in artificial intelligence, are reshaping the conditions under which science is produced, communicated and evaluated. These developments challenge traditional markers of quality and raise questions about trust, accountability, and governance.
STS offers critical tools to unpack these questions and challenges, having a long tradition in challenging the assumptions behind expertise and notions of quality. More recently, tensions have emerged between STS approaches and those of reform movements such as metascience and open science, which often propose technical or behavioural fixes to systemic problems. While these movements aim to improve science, they may also reproduce narrow or exclusionary visions of what “better” means. Reflections on these debates are also welcomed to this track.
We invite presentations that explore how research quality is defined, contested, and protected across disciplines, institutions, and cultures. Contributions may address conceptual, empirical, or methodological dimensions, and cover topics including, but not limited to:
Research ethics and integrity, scholarly communication and peer review, error correction, paper mills and organised attempts to corrupt the research literature, institutional corruption of science, open science and scientific reform movements, scientific sleuthing, overpromising, systemic ignorance.
