title: "Sleuth Mascot: Detective Platypus"
collection: portfolio
categories: [mascots]
excerpt: "I designed this mascot for the Symposium on Scientific Literature Decontamination in Paris. Platypus was chosen to represent the diverse participants we had in this meeting (and maybe a a little inspired by Detective Perry too, yes.) He is well prepared to sleuth in Paris with his fancy scarf and deerstalker! Check out his more Parisian look from the link above. <br/><img src='/images/platypus_original.jpg' width='200'>"
