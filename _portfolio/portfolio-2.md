title: "Sleuth Mascot: Detective Platypus"
collection: portfolio
categories: [mascots]
excerpt: "I designed this mascot for the Symposium on Scientific Literature Decontamination in Paris. Platypus was chosen to represent the diverse participants we had in this meeting (and maybe a a little inspired by [Perry the Platypus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perry_the_Platypus), yes.) He is well prepared to sleuth in Paris with his fancy scarf and deerstalker! Check out his more Parisian look from the link above. <br/><img src='/images/platypus_original.png' width='500'>"
