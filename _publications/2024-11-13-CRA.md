In this work, we explain our proposal to assess the impact of retracted papers on the reliability of articles that cite retracted literature. We plan to combine scientometrics and natural language processing (NLP) to estimate reliability. The ultimate goal is to create an automated framework to evaluate and flag potential reliability issues in scientific publications that cite retracted publications. As a first step, we collected and made available a dataset of metadata of articles that cite retracted literature.
