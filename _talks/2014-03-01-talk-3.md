To address the challenge of tracking the use of unreliable sources in scientific literature, we analyzed citations to retracted articles (CRAs) using retraction reasons (RRs) and citation context (CC) analysis. Our aim was to inform the development of automated tools for postpublication peer review (PPPR) by identifying instances in which a CRA is not only an unreliable source, but may also introduce unreliability into the citing work itself, depending on the way it is cited. We examined the degree to which the content of the citation context aligns with the RR, indicating potential risk for the integrity of the citing article.
