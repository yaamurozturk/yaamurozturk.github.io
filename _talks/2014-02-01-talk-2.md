Abstracts of scientific publications are widely used in scientometrics and text mining because they can be extracted in large quantities from bibliometric databases, and they convey important information about the publications. However, we found misregistered abstracts in Crossref published by Science and the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS). We aimed at estimating the proportion of misregistered abstracts in our dataset and providing the textual similarity between the correct abstracts and the misregistered texts. A previous study also found misregistered metadata in Crossref. [Check the poster on HAL](https://hal.science/hal-05287252v1)
